        <ul>
            <li>
                Cicadas can be black, brown or green and can have red, white or blue eyes.
                Cicadas wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a light source.
                The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.
                Cicadas make noise like toy frogs.
